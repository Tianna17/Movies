TMDB Movie API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US)

TMDB movie api need a api key, so I went ahead and sign up.

I start from scratch and will add file from bc_group4 start template, example: server.js.

git clone this repo
cd into it
yarn or npm install (I used npm)
npm start or yarn start to run app

This app will display movies, tv shows, people. I created only the movies section, which will fitler by popular, now playing, upcoming, top rated.
